# AAHYWEH
# Control file for plotting fingerprints using data from 2 or more OzFlux netCDF files.
# This version of the fingerprint control file is designed to allow the user to plot
# data from 2 or more OzFlux netCDF files on a single fingerprint plot.  This approach
# is useful for comparing, say, L3 data with gap filled drivers (L4) or fluxes (L5).
# Side by side comparison of gap filled and non-gap filled data can highlight problems
# with the gap filling approach used.
#
# TEMPLATE VERSION
#  To convert this template to a version that works for data output by the standard OzFlux
#  data logger program:
#   1) Replace the following place holders with values for your site:
#      <site_name> - the name of the site
#      <year>      - the year of the data
#
# [Variables] - section containing the variables to be plotted
#  Each sub-section in the [Variables] section defines a variable for which a fingerprint
#  is to be plotted.
#  Each variable name used when defining what fingerprints to plot in the [Plots] section
#  must have a corresponding entry in the [Variables] section.
#  In the example below, the L3 latent heat flux, named as Fe_L3, appears in the list
#  of variables for the first plot.  The data to use for Fe_L3 and where it is to come
#  from are defined in the [[Fe_L3]] sub-section of the [Variables] section.
#
#  Each sub-section in [Variables] must contain 2 entries:
#   in_filename - the name, complete with path, of the file containing the data
#   nc_varname  - the name of the variable to be read from the above file
#
#  There can be an arbitrary number of sub-sections in the [Variables] section.
#
# [Plots] - section containing the plots to be made
#  Each sub-section in the [Plots] section defines a fingerprint plot.  Each fingerprint
#  plot can have an arbitrary number of panels with each panel corresponding to a single
#  variable.  In practice, the panels become too narrow to be useful if there are more
#  than 5 or 6 panels on a single fingerprint plot.
#
#  Each sub-section in the [Plots] section must be uniquely numbered eg [[1]], [[2]],
#  [[3]], [[4]] etc.
#
#  Each sub-section in the [Plots] section must contain 2 entries:
#   Title     - a title for the fingerprint plot
#   Variables - a list of variables to be plotted as panels on a single fingerprint plot
#               - the list must be enclosed in double quote marks (")
#               - each entry in the list must be enclosed in single quote marks (')
#
#  There can be an arbitrary number of sub-sections in the [Plots] section.
